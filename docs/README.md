# Demo Image

This folder should contain a demo image showing the capabilities of ImageAlchemy, such as:

- Before/after comparison of a dress color transformation
- A grid showing multiple color variations of the same reference image
- Sample outputs with the pensive expression and anime-like eyes

## Creating a Demo Image

1. Run the generator:
   ```
   python generator.py
   ```

2. Select the best results from the output directory
3. Create a composite image showing the capabilities
4. Save it as `demo.png` in this directory
5. Update the link in the README.md if necessary
