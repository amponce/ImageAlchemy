Place your FLUX model files in this directory.

Expected files:
- flux_schnell.safetensors

These files are not included in the repository due to their large size.
You can download them from Hugging Face or other sources.

If you don't have the model files, the scripts will automatically download them from Hugging Face,
but this requires an internet connection and will be slower than using local files.
